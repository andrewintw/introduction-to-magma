## Course Overview

Learn about the Magma project, an open source implementation of a mobile network core. Magma supports diverse radio technologies, including LTE, 5G and WiFi, and is particularly relevant for extending network access into remote, sparsely populated areas.

Magma leverages open source software and commodity hardware to help operators manage their networks efficiently. It provides a high level of automation, high reliability, and the ability to deliver new network services quickly. It is agnostic to the radio access network technology, supporting any cellular “generation” from 2G to 5G, as well as WiFi and CBRS for unlicensed spectrum. Magma can be federated with existing cellular networks to allow networks to be cost-effectively extended into remote areas.

This course is designed for technology strategists or decision makers at telcos looking to understand the applicability of Magma to their environment. This course is also aimed at rural ISP operators, systems integrators, and anyone looking to set up a lab environment to experiment with Magma or deploy it in production.

This course will help you gain an understanding of the overall Magma architecture and how it fits into the bigger picture of cellular network architectures, particularly 4G/LTE and 5G. You will learn to recognize and understand the main functions of a mobile wireless network, understand the key use cases and value proposition of Magma, the overall architecture of Magma at a functional block level, and the functions performed by each of the main Magma components (Access Gateway, Federation Gateway, and Orchestrator). The course will also provide resources to learn more to deploy Magma on standard hardware.

This course prepares you to fully explore the Magma project. It provides the necessary background to help you determine if Magma is appropriate for your setting, and equips you to start installing and experimenting with the system.

## Getting Help

For any **technical issues** with the edX platform (including login problems and issues with the Verified Certificate), please use the Help icon located on the upper right side of your screen.

One great way to interact with peers taking this course and resolving any **content-related issues** is via the Discussion Forums. These forums can be used in the following ways:

* To introduce yourselves.
* To discuss concepts and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course material.
* To ask questions about course content.
* To share resources and ideas related to Magma and cloud native wireless technologies.

We strongly encourage you not only to ask questions, but to share with your peers opinions about the course content, as well as valuable related resources. The Discussion Forums will be reviewed periodically by The Linux Foundation staff, but it is primarily a community resource, not an 'ask the instructor' service.

**Note:** Before starting a thread about your issue, we strongly encourage you to do a quick search to see if your question has already been addressed. It’s often the case that there will be one or two threads asking the same question that has been answered.

When creating a new thread, be as specific as possible, both in the title and the body of your thread. Make sure to specify what chapter/section/page you are referring to.

To learn more tips on how to use them, read the following article: "[Getting the Most Out of the edX Discussion Forums](https://blog.edx.org/getting-most-out-edx-discussion-forums)".
